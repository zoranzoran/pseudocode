description: Within 3 months time we built native iOS app from scratch, based on mock screenshots provided by client. App UI and business logic is built in Swift. Some code for communication to Bluetooth sensors was inherited in Objective-C. We successfully fixed issues in old code, per client request, as well as gave feedback in every step of the way on how to improve app to be more effective from user's perspective. Application is gathering data from 5 different Bluetooth sensors and internal GPS, logs the data, communicates to server when possible and shows relevant statistics per bicycle ride all in the same time.
technologies: Native iOS, Objetive-C, Swift
